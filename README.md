## Description of the Game

**STAQS** is a strategic board game where players compete to control the tallest stacks of pieces on a grid. The game is played on a square board, with each cell initially containing a neutral piece. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board or stacking their pieces on top of existing stacks. The objective is to create the tallest stack of pieces by the end of the game.

### Rules:
1. **Setup Phase:**
   - Players take turns placing their pieces on any neutral cell on the board.
   - The setup phase continues until all pieces are placed.

2. **Play Phase:**
   - Players take turns moving their stacks.
   - Players can only stack their pieces on top of their own stacks or neutral stacks.
   - Stacks can only be moved orthogonally (horizontally or vertically) to an adjacent cell.

3. **End of the Game:**
   - The game ends when no more valid moves are available for both players.
   - The player with the tallest stack wins the game.
   - In case of a tie in the tallest stack, the player with the second tallest stack wins.

## Considerations for Game Extensions

### Variable-Sized Boards
When extending the game design to support variable-sized boards, the following considerations were taken into account:

1. **Board Initialization:**
   - The game should allow players to choose the board size at the start of the game.
   - The board size can range from 4x4 to 10x10, providing flexibility for different game durations and strategies.

2. **Game Balance:**
   - The rules and mechanics should be adjusted to ensure balanced gameplay across different board sizes.
   - Larger boards may require additional pieces or modified rules to maintain the game's strategic depth.

3. **User Interface:**
   - The user interface should dynamically adjust to display the chosen board size.
   - Input validation should ensure that players enter valid board sizes within the allowed range.

4. **Performance:**
   - The implementation should be optimized to handle larger board sizes without significant performance degradation.
   - Efficient algorithms for move validation and game state evaluation are crucial for maintaining a smooth gameplay experience.

These considerations ensure that the game remains engaging and balanced, regardless of the chosen board size.

## Game Logic

### Game Configuration Representation
The game configuration is represented by a list of parameters that define the initial setup of the game. This includes the board size, player types, optional rules, and player names. The `initial_state/2` predicate uses this configuration to set up the initial game state.

### Internal Game State Representation
The internal game state is represented by a `state/5` structure:
- `Board`: A list of lists representing the board, where each cell contains a piece or stack in the format `Player-Count`.
- `CurrentPlayer`: The player whose turn it is to move.
- `Pieces`: A list of remaining pieces for each player.
- `Phase`: The current phase of the game (`setup` or `play`).
- `BoardSize`: The size of the board.

Example representations:
- Initial state: `state([[n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1], [n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1], [n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1], [n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1], [n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1]], blue, [blue-4, white-4], setup, 5)`
- Intermediate state: `state([[blue-2, n-1, n-1, n-1, white-2], [blue-2, n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1], [n-1, n-1, blue-2, n-1, white-2], [n-1, n-1, n-1, blue-2, n-1], [white-2, white-2, n-1, n-1, n-1]], blue, [blue-0, white-0], play, 5)`
- Final state: `state([[blue-9, e-0, e-0, e-0, white-9], [e-0, e-0, e-0, e-0, e-0], [e-0, e-0, blue-7, e-0, white-7], [e-0, e-0, e-0, blue-2, e-0], [white-4, e-0, e-0, e-0, e-0]], blue, [blue-0, white-0], play, 5)`

### Move Representation
Moves are represented by structures indicating the type of move and the coordinates involved:
- `place(Y, X)`: Place a piece at the specified coordinates during the setup phase.
- `stack(Y1, X1, Y2, X2)`: Move a stack from one cell to an adjacent cell during the play phase.
- `skip`: Skip the turn if no valid moves are available.

The `move/3` predicate applies the move to the game state and returns the new state.

### User Interaction
The game menu system allows players to select the game type, board size, and difficulty level. Interaction with the user is performed through prompts and input validation to ensure valid moves are entered. The `get_player_move/4` predicate handles user input and validates moves.

## Conclusions

### Limitations
One of the main limitations of the current implementation is the lack of strategic depth during the setup phase. In this phase, players place their pieces on the board, but there isn't much room for strategic decision-making. As a result, the AI uses only the random move selection algorithm during the setup phase, regardless of the chosen difficulty level. This simplifies the setup phase but may not provide the most engaging experience for players looking for a more challenging AI opponent from the start.

### Possible Improvements
1. **Enhanced AI for Setup Phase:**
   - Develop more sophisticated algorithms for the setup phase to introduce strategic depth and make the game more challenging from the beginning.

2. **Additional Game Modes:**
   - Introduce new game modes with different rules or objectives to provide variety and cater to different player preferences.

3. **Improved User Interface:**
   - Enhance the user interface to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing experience, including better input validation and error handling.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Further optimize the game logic to handle larger board sizes and more complex game states efficiently.

### Future Developments Roadmap
1. **AI Enhancements:**
   - Implement advanced AI strategies for both the setup and play phases, including machine learning techniques to adapt to player behavior.

2. **Multiplayer Support:**
   - Add support for online multiplayer games, allowing players to compete against each other over the internet.

3. **Mobile and Web Versions:**
   - Develop mobile and web versions of the game to reach a broader audience and provide a seamless gaming experience across different platforms.


### Conclusions about the Work Carried Out
The development of the STAQS game in Prolog has been a valuable learning experience, providing insights into game design, AI algorithms, and user interaction. The project successfully implemented a functional game with variable-sized boards and different difficulty levels. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in enhancing the AI's strategic capabilities during the setup phase and optimizing performance for larger boards. Overall, the project demonstrates the potential of Prolog for developing complex logic-based games and sets the foundation for future enhancements and extensions.
